This short tutorial shows how to simulate a given Gibbs model of T-tessellation. The simulation algorithm is described the in paper "A completely random T-tessellation model and Gibbsian extensions". It is a Metropolis-Hastings-Green algorithm. Three main ingredients are involved in the simulation:
- A dynamic T-tessellation. That is a T-tessellation that can evolve with time.
- A Gibbs model specified by an energy function. T-tessellation with low energy are more likely.
- A simulation engine that make the dynamic T-tessellation evolve according to the specified model. 
The series of T-tessellations generated by the algorithm is a Markov chain of T-tessellations that converges in law to the target distribution.

Below is the whole program. Comments about its different parts follow.

    #include ttessel.h
    int main(int argc,char** argv) {
      int seed = 5;               // seed for the random generator
      double width = 1;           // side length of the square domain to be tessellated
      double theta_segs = 3.15;   // first parameter value
      double theta_faces = 10000; // second parameter value
      TTessel tes; 
      tes.insert_window(Rectangle(Point2(0,0),Point2(width,width)));
      Energy mod;
      mod.add_features_segs(is_segment_internal);
      mod.add_theta_segs(theta_segs);
      mod.add_features_faces(face_area_2);
      mod.add_theta_faces(theta_faces);
      mod.set_ttessel(tes);
      std::cout << "Current energy: " << mod.get_value() << std::endl;
      SMFChain sim = SMFChain(&mod,0.33,0.33); 
      rnd = new CGAL::Random(seed);
      for(int i=0;i!=100;i++) {
        sim.step();
        std::cout << "Current energy: " << mod.get_value() << std::endl;
      }
    return 0;
    }

Create a dynamic T-tessellation object
--------------------------------------
A dynamic T-tessellation is represented by a TTessel object.

    TTessel tes; 

Before it is really effective, one should define the domain to be tessellated. It must be a bounded convex polygon. Here it is a square window.

    tes.insert_window(Rectangle(Point2(0,0),Point2(width,width)));

Define the Gibbs model to be simulated
--------------------------------------
A stochastic model of T-tessellation is defined through an energy function. For a given energy function \f$E\f$, the infinitesimal probability to observe a T-tessellation \f$T\f$ is
\f[
P(dT) \propto \exp\left(-E(T)\right).
\f]
Using Energy objects, one may define a large class of parametric models. As an example, consider the model where the energy function has the form:
\f[
  E_\theta(T) = \stackrel{\circ}{n}_\mathrm{s}(T)\theta_1+a^2(T)\theta_2,
\f]
where \f$\stackrel{\circ}{n}_\mathrm{s}(T)\f$ is the number of tessellation segments not lying along the domain boundary and \f$a^2(T)\f$ is the sum of squared cell areas. Observe that the first term of the energy  penalizes T-tessellations with too many segments (cells), while the second term penalizes T-tessellation with heterogeneous cell areas. The numerical values of the parameters are the following:
\f{eqnarray*}{
\theta_1 & = & 3.15,\\
\theta_2 & = & 10000.
\f}

Let us push the first energy term into the model. The number of internal segments can be written as
\f[
  \left(\sum_{s\in S(T)} I\{s\mbox{ is internal}\}\right),
\f]
where \f$S(T)\f$ is the set of segments of the tessellation \f$T\f$. The following piece of code push this term into the model.

    Energy mod;
    mod.add_features_segs(is_segment_internal);
    mod.add_theta_segs(theta_segs);

The handling of the second term is similar. The sum \f$a^2(T)\f$ of squared cell areas can be written as
\f[
\sum_{c\in C(T)} a(c)^2,
\f]
where \f$C(T)\f$ is the set of cells (i.e. faces) of the tessellation \f$T\f$ and \f$a(c)\f$ is the area of the cell \f$c\f$.

    mod.add_features_faces(face_area_2);
    mod.add_theta_faces(theta_faces);

Now attach the dynamic T-tessellation object to the model object and evaluate the model energy for the current T-tessellation (empty tessellation).
  
    mod.set_ttessel(tes);
    std::cout << "Current energy: " << mod.get_value() << std::endl;

Set up the simulator and run it
-------------------------------

The class SMFChain implements a simulation engine. It is an algorithm of Metropolis-Hastings-Green type defining a Markov chain in the space of T-tessellations. Transitions of the Markov chain are either merges, splits of flips (SMF). When defining a SMFChain object, one needs to specifiy 2 probabilities : probability of proposing a merge, probability of proposing a split (the third probability for flips is complementary). Very often, these probabilities are chosen uniform.

    SMFChain sim = SMFChain(&mod,0.33,0.33); 

We are now ready for running the simulator through its method SMFChain::step. As a prerequisite, the random generator must be initialized.

    rnd = new CGAL::Random(seed);
    for(int i=0;i!=100;i++) {
      sim.step();
      std::cout << "Current energy: " << mod.get_value() << std::endl;
    }
